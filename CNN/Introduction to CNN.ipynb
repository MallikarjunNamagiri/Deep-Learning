    "# Convolutional Neural Network\n",
    "    Convolutional Neural Networks or CNNs, are a specialized kind of neural network for processing data that has a known grid-like topology. Examples include time-series data, which canbe thought of as a 1-D grid taking samples at regular time intervals, and image data,which can be thought of as a 2-D grid of pixels. Convolutional networks have beentremendously successful in practical applications.\n",
    "    The name **“convolutional neuralnetwork”** indicates that the network employs a mathematical operation calledconvolution. Convolution is a specialized kind of linear operation. Convolutionalnetworks are simply neural networks that use convolution in place of general matrixmultiplication in at least one of their layers."
